# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is to detect any abnormal behavior of people in the video sequence.
The data set used to produce results is PETS 2006 data which consists
of video sequences from 4 cameras. We used video frames from 3 cameras for
our experiments. Training sequence of 120 frames is selected from each video
sequence. The trained parameters are tested on 1000 frames captures from each
camera.
